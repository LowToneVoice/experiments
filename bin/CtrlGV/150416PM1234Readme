(Example)
DAQStorageExperiment 30 30 65 30 50

OpenGVTime         = 30000000; //GV1 and GV2 open
ImportTime         = 30000000; //GV1 closes and GV2 opens
StorageTime        = 65000000; //GV1 and GV2 close
DAQTime            = 30000000; //GV1 opens and GV2 close for taking data by using Dunia-10
CleaningTime       = 50000000; //GV1 opens and GV2 close for cleaning

Cycle repeats a follwing procedure: Cleaning->OpenGV->Import->Storage->DAQ->Cleaning ...
